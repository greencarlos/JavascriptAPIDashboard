**Added Bootstrap for CSS styles, but pretty ready to move on in the curriculum**

### 🐶 Dog API
Show a random dog picture

- Pretty simple approach, just add an image of a dog, nothing too crazy

### 🐱 Cat API
Show a random cat picture

- Same as the dog api, just a random cat image

### 🌤️ Weather
Show the temperature for the user's current city

- A bit more tricky, but got done with the Google Weather Api with Geolocation

### 💱 Currency
Exchange Rate API for the core 4 English-speaking countries

### 🎬 Movies
Display top trending movies

- Random list of 10 movies that are currently 'trending'

### 🧑‍💻 GitHub API
Show the profile of a user

- Just show my user profile

### 😂 JokeAPI
Display a random joke

### 📚 Public APIs
Show a randomly featured API

- Created a global array to add Api Urls as we go along
- Then used a helper function to add only 20 URLs maximum to avoid having too much data
